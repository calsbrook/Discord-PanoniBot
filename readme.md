# PanoniBot
This is a discord bot that I've been using to learn the discord API.  Lately I've been pretty inspired to add new features.

## Features

### Tic Tac Toe
By typing `!ticTacToe` you can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with a friend.  It doesn't control for who is sending the messages yet, so you'll have to be civil (I know this is an impossible thing to ask)

### Vote
By typing `!vote` followed by your poll question you can conduct a yes or no vote with everyone in the chat.  By default it allows 15 seconds for voting.

### 8Ball
By typing `!8ball` followed by a question, you can find out the answers to any (yes or no) question you've ever had.

### Ping
By typing `!ping` you can get the latency of both the client and the API

### Info
By typing `!info` you get to see the least impressive feature.  If you type `!info` by itself it gives you a list of the commands you can get info on by typing `!info command`


## Future plans
I would like to make a text based peer-to-peer battleship facilitated by chatting with this bot. I'd also be interested in working with the reddit API to bring a top post from a subreddit when asked.
